# Text Sentiment Analysis using Pytorch
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on text data extracted from Twitter/Reddit using PyTorch. Sentiment analysis involves determining whether a given text expresses a positive, negative or neutral sentiment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of text data extracted from Twitter/Reddit. It contains a mixture of positive, negative and neutral tweets/posts. The dataset is preprocessed to remove irrelevant data such as hashtags, URLs and user mentions. The dataset is split into training, validation and testing sets.

## Model
The sentiment analysis model used in this project is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network implemented using PyTorch. The model takes the preprocessed text data as input and produces a sentiment score as output. The model is designed and ready to be trained on the training set using the ... 

## Usage
This project will be available as a web application that takes text input of any kind and outputs a positive, negative or neutral sentiment. 

## Future Work
Implement the training code to train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
Test the model on the testing set to evaluate its performance.
Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model.
